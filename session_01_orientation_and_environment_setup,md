# Session 1: Orientation & Environment Setup

## Explanations

### Introduction and Context

In this first session, we focus on ensuring that your development environment is ready for creating C applications with the SplashKit library on a Linux system. By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- Understand what SplashKit is and why we use it.
- Set up a Linux environment suitable for C programming with SplashKit.
- Compile and run a basic “Hello, SplashKit!” application that opens a window, confirming that everything is installed correctly.

#### What is SplashKit?

[SplashKit](https://www.splashkit.io/) is a cross-platform library that simplifies multimedia programming in C (and other languages it supports). It provides easy-to-use functions for creating graphical windows, rendering images and text, handling audio playback, processing user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse), and more. While you could do all these tasks using low-level system calls or multiple specialized libraries (like SDL, OpenGL, or platform-specific APIs), SplashKit packages these capabilities into a single, beginner-friendly interface. This is especially helpful when you are more interested in building games and interactive applications than wrestling with low-level details.

**Why SplashKit for Intermediate C Learners?**  
If you have a background in C programming (loops, functions, pointers, memory management) but haven’t yet tried building graphical or interactive applications, SplashKit gives you a straightforward path to do so. It hides a lot of complexity so you can focus on the logic and design of your application.

### Concept A: Installing and Configuring SplashKit on Linux

Before coding anything, you must have a working Linux environment ready for C development. This includes:

1. A C Compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`).
2. The SplashKit SDK installed and configured.
3. Basic build tools and libraries required by SplashKit.

**Why Install a Dedicated Environment?**  
A properly set up environment ensures a consistent workflow. If everyone uses the same or similar configuration, it’s easier to follow tutorials, reproduce results, and troubleshoot problems. Isolating dependencies and using tools like `pkg-config` or `Makefiles` ensures your projects remain portable and maintainable.

**Common Tools and Their Roles:**

- **C Compiler (`gcc`):** Translates your C source code into binary executables.
- **Make and Makefiles:** Automates compilation using a simple configuration file, making building your project easier. Instead of remembering a long compile command, you run `make` to build your code.
- **SplashKit Libraries:** Precompiled binaries and headers that provide the functions and data types for graphics, audio, input handling, and more.

**Step-by-Step Installation:**

1. **Update Your System Packages:**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```
   Keeping your system up-to-date ensures you have the latest stable tools.

2. **Install a C Compiler and Build Essentials:**  
   On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```
   This installs `gcc`, `make`, and other essentials.

3. **Install SplashKit:**
   Follow the official installation instructions from the [SplashKit Installation Guide](https://splashkit.io/). Typically, this involves:
   - Downloading SplashKit for Linux (a package or a tarball).
   - Running an installer script or manually placing headers and libraries in standard directories.
   - Ensuring the `splashkit.h` header and `libsplashkit.so` (or equivalent files) are in locations where `gcc` and the linker can find them.
   
   After installation, you might need to set environment variables, such as:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   This ensures the system can find SplashKit’s shared libraries at runtime.

4. **Verify the Installation:**  
   Use `pkg-config` or a provided configuration script to ensure SplashKit can be located:
   ```bash
   pkg-config --cflags --libs splashkit
   ```
   This command should output the compiler and linker flags needed to build a SplashKit program. If it doesn’t, check your installation steps or documentation.

**Why This Matters:**  
If your installation is correct, you can compile and run SplashKit programs without wrestling with complex linker errors. A stable environment reduces frustration and lets you concentrate on learning SplashKit’s API and building interesting applications.

**Common Alternatives and Variations:**

- You could use `clang` instead of `gcc`.
- Some users prefer building from source if binary packages are not available for their distribution.
- Environment isolation tools like Docker containers can be used to maintain a clean, reproducible environment.

**Links and Resources:**

- [Official SplashKit Documentation](https://www.splashkit.io/)
- [Linux Command-Line Basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
- [GNU Make Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

### Concept B: Creating a “Hello, SplashKit!” Program

After installation, the next step is to confirm everything works by writing a very simple C program that uses SplashKit. The typical “Hello, World!” in a graphical library is to open a window and draw something minimal on it (like text or a background).

**What This Program Does:**

- Initializes SplashKit (sets up graphics, input, etc.).
- Opens a window with a specified width, height, and title.
- Waits a few seconds or until a key is pressed, then closes.

**Key Components of a SplashKit Program:**

- **Include the Header:** `#include "splashkit.h"`
- **Initialization:** Calling functions to open a window, load resources if needed.
- **Main Loop:** Typically, a game loop continuously updates the screen. For now, a simple pause or wait before closing is enough.
- **Tear Down:** Ensuring resources are freed and the window is closed cleanly.

**Why Follow This Structure?**  
This structure mirrors what you’ll do in real applications: initialize resources, run a loop that checks for input and updates graphics, and close everything gracefully at the end.

**Example Skeleton:**
```c
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("Hello, SplashKit!", 800, 600);
    delay(3000); // Wait 3 seconds
    close_window("Hello, SplashKit!");
    return 0;
}
```

This code should open a window titled “Hello, SplashKit!” at 800x600 pixels, show it for 3 seconds, and then close. By running this, you confirm that SplashKit is correctly installed and linked.

**Compiling & Running:**
Assuming `pkg-config` works for SplashKit, you can compile like so:
```bash
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs splashkit` hello_splashkit.c -o hello_splashkit
./hello_splashkit
```

If the window appears and closes as expected, your environment is ready!

**Common Variations:**

- Different window sizes or titles.
- Adding simple shapes or text right away. For example:
```c
draw_text("Welcome to SplashKit!", COLOR_WHITE, "Arial", 24, 50, 50);
refresh_screen();
delay(3000);
```
- Changing the wait condition from a time delay to user input (e.g., press ESC to exit).

  (Check “window management” and “drawing” functions.)

## Exercises

Below are exercises designed to reinforce the concepts explained above. Each exercise includes:

- A description of what to do.
- Starter code.
- Input/Output specifications.
- Example scenarios.

After attempting the exercises, you can check the provided reference solutions and run the autotests to validate your work.

### Exercise 1: Verify Your System Configuration

**Goal:** Write a C program that prints out a confirmation message indicating that your environment is ready. This helps verify the compiler and basic I/O are working before moving on to SplashKit-specific tasks.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- Printing output to the console in C.
- Confirming the basic toolchain is functional.

**Instructions:**
1. In `task1.c`, write a program that:
   - Prints “C environment ready!” to `stdout`.
   - Returns 0 to indicate success.

2. Compile and run it:
   ```bash
   gcc task1.c -o task1
   ./task1
   ```

3. Check that it prints the correct message.

**No external input required.**  
**Expected Output:**  
```
C environment ready!
```

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task1.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Print the confirmation message.
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 2: Compile and Run a Basic SplashKit Program

**Goal:** Create a minimal “Hello, SplashKit!” program that opens a window. You’ll be using SplashKit this time.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- Including `splashkit.h`
- Calling `open_window` and `close_window`
- Verifying SplashKit installation

**Instructions:**

1. In `task2.c`, write a program that:
   - Includes `splashkit.h`.
   - Opens a window titled “My First SplashKit App” at 640x480 pixels.
   - Waits for 2 seconds.
   - Closes the window.
   - Prints “Window closed successfully!” to the console before exiting.

2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs splashkit` task2.c -o task2
   ./task2
   ```
   
**No external input required.**  

**Expected Output:**  

A window opens for 2 seconds, then closes, and the console prints:  
```
Window closed successfully!
```

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task2.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Open a window, wait, close it, and print a confirmation.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 3: Modify Window Appearance

**Goal:** Build upon the previous exercise by drawing text onto the SplashKit window before closing.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- Drawing text on the screen using `draw_text`
- Refreshing the screen to display changes

**Instructions:**

1. In `task3.c`, write a program that:
   - Opens a window titled “SplashKit Display” at 800x600 pixels.
   - Draws the text “SplashKit is running!” at coordinates (100, 100) in white color.
   - Calls `refresh_screen()` to ensure the text is visible.
   - Waits 3 seconds.
   - Closes the window and prints “All good!” to `stdout`.

2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs splashkit` task3.c -o task3
   ./task3
   ```

**No external input required.**  
**Expected Output:**  
A window with the message “SplashKit is running!” displayed, visible for 3 seconds, then closes and prints:  
```
All good!
```

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task3.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Open window, draw text, refresh, wait, close and print message.
    return 0;
}
```
