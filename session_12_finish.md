# Session 12: Course Wrap-Up, Best Practices, and Next Steps

## Explanations

After completing the previous sessions, multi-stage assignments, and the capstone project, you’ve gained substantial experience in building interactive, 2D applications with SplashKit and C. This session focuses on **wrapping up the course**, **reflecting on best practices**, **exploring next steps**, and **providing additional resources** for continued growth.

By the end of this session, you should:

- Understand how to maintain and improve your codebase over time.
- Know where to find advanced resources and documentation.
- Have strategies for presenting your projects (like the capstone) as a portfolio piece.
- Learn about possible directions beyond SplashKit and how to integrate new technologies or libraries.

### Concept A: Best Practices in Code Maintenance and Scaling

**Why Ongoing Maintenance Matters:**

As your project grows, maintaining and scaling it becomes challenging. Good habits ensure that adding new features or fixing bugs doesn’t become overwhelming.

**Key Practices:**

1. **Modular Code and Reusable Functions:**
   - Break large code files into smaller modules (e.g., separate files for player logic, enemy logic, and UI).
   - Write reusable functions or classes (if using C with a procedural style, consider organized structs and function sets) that handle common tasks (e.g., loading sprites, playing sounds).

2. **Consistent Naming and Coding Style:**
   - Pick a coding convention and stick to it: consistent naming, indentation, and commenting.
   - This makes your code easier to read, both for you and for others.

3. **Regular Refactoring:**
   - As you add features, revisit old code to simplify or optimize it.
   - Remove dead code and debug prints after finishing debugging.

4. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git or another version control system to track changes, allowing you to revert to previous states if something goes wrong.
   - Commit small, logical changes with clear messages.

### Concept B: Documenting and Showcasing Your Projects

**Documentation:**

- Add comments explaining how your code works and why certain decisions were made.
- Create a `README.md` file summarizing the project, how to run it, and any dependencies.
- Document key functions and data structures. This is invaluable for future maintenance or sharing your code.

**Showcasing (Portfolio):**

- Record a short gameplay video or take screenshots of your final capstone game.
- Write a brief description of what the game is, what technologies it uses, and what you learned from building it.
- Potential employers or teammates appreciate seeing a concise demonstration of your skills and reasoning.

### Concept C: Additional Resources and Advanced Learning

**SplashKit Documentation:**

- Revisit [SplashKit Official Documentation](https://www.splashkit.io/) for details on advanced APIs you might not have explored.
- Check for updates or new features in SplashKit’s repository or community forums.

**C Language and Beyond:**

- Improve your C skills by reading resources like “The C Programming Language” by Kernighan and Ritchie, or online tutorials.
- Learn memory management, pointers, and data structures deeply—important for optimizing and avoiding bugs.
- Consider learning about other languages or frameworks to broaden your toolset.

**Game Development Techniques:**

- Explore game-specific algorithms (pathfinding, AI states, particle systems) to enhance future projects.
- Study well-known patterns in game development (entity-component-system architectures, finite state machines, event-driven programming).

---

### Concept D: Going Beyond SplashKit

**Using Other Libraries or Engines:**

- If you want more control or 3D capabilities, consider SDL, SFML, or game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.
- For networking, integrate external libraries (e.g., ENet) to add multiplayer features.

**Integrations and Tools:**

- Profilers (Valgrind, gprof) for deeper performance analysis.
- Memory checkers (Valgrind’s memcheck) to catch leaks.
- Continuous integration services (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate building and testing.

---

### Concept E: Long-Term Growth and Community Involvement

**Joining Communities:**

- Engage in online forums, Discord servers, or GitHub discussions about SplashKit or C game development.
- Ask for feedback on your code or offer help to beginners. Teaching others solidifies your knowledge.

**Contributing to Open Source:**

- Consider contributing to SplashKit’s open-source repositories if available.
- Improving documentation, reporting bugs, or adding small features helps you learn and connect with developers.

**Setting Personal Goals:**

- Plan a new project challenging yourself in new areas (e.g., a networked game, an AI-driven puzzle).
- Set milestones for learning new technologies or improving code quality metrics (like maintaining 60 FPS under certain conditions).

## Exercises (No New Code Tasks, Just Reflection and Documentation)

### Exercise 1: Code Review and Refactoring

**Goal:**  
Review and refactor a portion of your assignment or capstone code.

**Instructions:**
- Pick a complex function or module in your capstone.
- Add comments to explain logic.
- Rename variables to be more descriptive.
- Extract repeated code segments into a helper function.
- Ensure formatting and indentation are consistent.

**Testing:**
- Run existing tests to confirm no behavioral changes.
- Manually read the code: is it clearer and easier to follow?

### Exercise 2: Documentation Writing

**Goal:**  
Create a `README.md` for your capstone project.

**Instructions:**
- Include project title, a short description, controls, and dependencies.
- Explain how to compile and run the game.
- Add screenshots or short GIF if possible.
- Mention known issues and future improvements.

**Testing:**
- Have someone else read the README and see if they understand how to run your game without asking questions.

### Exercise 3: Performance Checks

**Goal:**  
Measure FPS at various points in your capstone and identify any drop.

**Instructions:**
- Add an FPS counter (from Session 10) to your capstone.
- Identify areas where FPS drops significantly (e.g., during heavy collision checks).
- Try disabling certain features (like drawing all entities) to see if FPS improves.
- Document findings in a short report (session12_resources.txt).

**Testing:**
- Show FPS on screen.
- Press a key to disable a feature and note if FPS rises.
- Conclude which features are most costly.

### Exercise 4: Exploration Beyond the Course

**Goal:**  
Research one additional feature or library to integrate or learn about.

**Instructions:**
- Pick a concept not covered deeply here (e.g., advanced audio mixing, scripting via Lua, or networking).
- Write a short summary in `session12_additional_reading.md` about what it does, how it could enhance your game, and resources you found.
- No code required, just research and planning.

**Testing:**
- Self-evaluate if the summary is understandable and outlines clear next steps for exploration.

## Reference and Resources

**Files Created:**

- `session12_resources.txt`: For performance findings.
- `session12_additional_reading.md`: Notes on new libraries or concepts.
- `session12_final_tips.txt`: (You can create a tips file summarizing best practices and next steps.)

**No New Solution Files Provided:**
Since this session focuses on reflection, documentation, and exploration rather than coding new features, no reference code solutions are needed. However, you can maintain your existing code and integrate changes as you see fit.
