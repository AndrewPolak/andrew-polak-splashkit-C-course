# Session 6: Audio & Media Integration

## Explanations

### Introduction and Context

Visuals and interactivity are crucial for a compelling application, but **audio** completes the experience. From background music that sets the mood to sound effects that give feedback on user actions, audio is a powerful tool that can transform a basic program into an immersive, emotionally engaging environment.

In this session, you’ll learn how to integrate **sound effects and music** into your SplashKit applications. You will understand:

- How to load and play short sound effects.
- How to loop background music tracks and control their playback.
- How to adjust volume and stop/pause audio as needed.
- How to trigger audio events in response to user actions or game states.

By mastering these techniques, you can enhance user feedback, reinforce thematic elements, and improve the overall feel of your application.

### Concept A: Understanding Sound Effects (SFX)

**What Are Sound Effects?**

Sound effects are short, discrete audio clips that usually last only a fraction of a second to a few seconds. They are used to highlight specific events—such as a button click, a character jumping, picking up an item, or a collision. Sound effects:

- Provide immediate feedback to the user’s actions.
- Reinforce important events or transitions.
- Enhance realism and immersion (footsteps on different surfaces, a door creaking, etc.).

**Loading Sound Effects:**

In SplashKit, sound effects are loaded similarly to images or fonts. For example:

```c
sound_effect my_sfx = load_sound_effect("my_sfx", "audio/jump.wav");
```

Here’s what’s happening:

- `"my_sfx"` is a resource name you use to refer to this sound effect.
- `"audio/jump.wav"` is the file path to the sound file. WAV format is common for sound effects due to its simplicity and broad support.

**Playing Sound Effects:**

Once loaded, you can play the sound with:

```c
play_sound_effect(my_sfx);
```

This plays the sound once at default volume. You can also specify parameters:

```c
play_sound_effect(my_sfx, 0, 1.0);
```

- The second parameter is the loop count (0 means play once, 1 would mean play twice in total, etc.).
- The third is the volume from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Stopping Sound Effects:**

If needed, you can stop a currently playing sound effect:

```c
stop_sound_effect(my_sfx);
```

This halts the sound if it’s still playing.

**When to Use:**
- Trigger a short sound every time the user presses a button (like a “click”).
- Play a “ding” sound when a task completes.
- Add footstep sounds when a character moves.

---

### Concept B: Understanding Music (Background and Long-Form Audio)

**What Is Music in SplashKit?**

Music is typically a longer audio track, often looping, that sets the mood or atmosphere. It can be a background track playing while the user navigates menus or a theme playing in-game. Unlike short sound effects, music often runs continuously and loops throughout gameplay or a scene.

**Loading Music:**

```c
music bg_track = load_music("bg_track", "audio/background.mp3");
```

Here, `"bg_track"` is the resource name, and `"audio/background.mp3"` is the file path. Music can be in `.mp3`, `.ogg`, or other supported formats. MP3 is common for longer audio tracks.

**Playing Music:**

```c
play_music(bg_track, -1);
```

The `-1` parameter often indicates looping indefinitely. Without parameters, it may default to playing once, so always specify loops if you want continuous playback.

**Stopping, Pausing, and Resuming Music:**

- `stop_music();` stops any currently playing music.
- `pause_music();` pauses, and `resume_music();` continues from where it paused.
- `music_playing()` returns `true` if music is currently playing, so you can check and toggle states as needed.

**When to Use:**
- Provide a continuous atmospheric background track during gameplay.
- Transition between different music tracks in menus or different levels/scenes.
- Pause or lower the volume of music during cutscenes or dialogues.

---

### Concept C: Volume Control and Advanced Audio Management

**Volume Control:**

You can adjust the volume of music and (sometimes) sound effects:

```c
set_music_volume(volume);
```

`volume` ranges from 0.0 (mute) to 1.0 (full volume). This allows dynamic adjustments, such as:

- Increasing music volume as the user progresses to a more intense area.
- Muting or lowering volume when the user opens a settings menu.
- Providing user-configurable volume sliders.

For sound effects, if the API supports it, you might specify volume at playback. For example:

```c
play_sound_effect(my_sfx, 0, 0.5); // Play at half volume
```

If you need finer control (e.g., global SFX volume), consult SplashKit’s documentation for additional functions.

**Fading and Other Effects:**

Some audio APIs include functions for fading music in or out. For example, you might fade music out before switching tracks to ensure a smooth transition. If available, look for functions like `fade_music_in(...)` or `fade_music_out(...)` in SplashKit’s documentation.

---

### Concept D: Integrating Audio with User Actions and States

**Triggering Sound by Input:**

- If the user presses SPACE to jump, play a “jump” SFX.
- If the user clicks a button with the mouse, play a “click” SFX.
- On finishing a level, play a “victory” SFX or change the music track.

**Controlling Music by Game State:**
- Start background music when the game begins.
- Switch to a different track when the user enters a new area.
- Stop or lower volume during pause screens or dialogues for dramatic effect.

**Responsive Audio:**
Audio should not just loop independently; it should respond to what’s happening. This responsiveness is what makes an application feel alive and dynamic.

---

### Concept E: Main Loop Integration

A typical frame might look like this:

1. `process_events();` – to handle input.
2. Check conditions:
   - If user pressed a certain key, play a sound effect.
   - If user toggled the music with a key, stop or resume music.
3. Update volumes or music states as needed.
4. Draw and refresh the screen as usual.

As you develop more complex projects, you’ll have multiple sound effects for various events, one or more music tracks playing in the background, and possibly dynamic volume adjustments. Good resource management and a clear naming convention are key.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Play a Sound Effect on Key Press

**Goal:**  
Load a short sound effect and play it each time the user presses the SPACE_KEY. Press ESC to exit.

**Instructions:**
- `load_sound_effect("beep", "audio/beep.wav");`
- If `key_typed(SPACE_KEY)`, `play_sound_effect(sound_effect_named("beep"));`
- If `key_typed(ESCAPE_KEY)`, exit.
- Watch the console or rely on your ears—each SPACE press should trigger the sound.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task1.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Play a sound effect on SPACE_KEY press.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 2: Background Music with Toggle

**Goal:**  
Load a music track and start playing it at launch. Press `M_KEY` to toggle music on/off. Press ESC to exit.

**Instructions:**
- `load_music("bg_music", "audio/background.mp3");`
- `play_music(music_named("bg_music"), -1);` // loop indefinitely
- If `key_typed(M_KEY)`:
  - If currently playing, `stop_music();`
  - Else `play_music(music_named("bg_music"), -1);`
- ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task2.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Toggle background music with M_KEY.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 3: Volume Control

**Goal:**  
Adjust music volume using the UP and DOWN arrow keys. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**
- Start playing background music.
- UP_KEY increases volume by 0.1 (max 1.0).
- DOWN_KEY decreases volume by 0.1 (min 0.0).
- Display current volume on-screen with `draw_text()`.
- ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task3.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Adjust music volume with UP/DOWN keys.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 4: Multiple Sound Effects and Conditions

**Goal:**  
Play different sound effects based on different actions:

- `click.wav` when the user clicks the left mouse button.
- `ding.wav` when the user presses ENTER.
- Background music plays throughout.
- ESC to exit.

**Instructions:**
- `load_sound_effect("click", "audio/click.wav");`
- `load_sound_effect("ding", "audio/ding.wav");`
- `play_music(music_named("bg_music"), -1);`
- On `mouse_clicked(LEFT_BUTTON)` -> `play_sound_effect(click)`.
- On `key_typed(ENTER_KEY)` -> `play_sound_effect(ding)`.
- ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task4.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Multiple sound effects triggered by input, plus background music.
    return 0;
}
```

## Autotest Scripts

As before, autotests ensure compilation and execution without errors but cannot test audio output. Manual testing with actual audio files is needed.

### Autotest for Exercise 1

```python
# Save as: task1_test.py

    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Compilation failed for {src_file}.\nStderr: {result.stderr}")
