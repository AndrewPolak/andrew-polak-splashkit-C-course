# Session 9: Advanced SplashKit Features

## Explanations

### Introduction and Context

You’ve already learned how to create graphical windows, display sprites, handle input, play audio, manage game states, handle collisions, and even apply simple physics. These are strong foundations for building 2D applications and games. However, there are more advanced features in SplashKit that can take your projects to the next level. This session focuses on three key areas:

1. **Timers and Scheduling:** Trigger events after a delay or at fixed intervals, and measure how long something has been happening.  
2. **Text Input and Basic UI Elements:** Capture user-typed text, and create simple menus or input prompts.  
3. **Saving and Loading Game State:** Persist data (like high scores or player progress) between sessions.

By mastering these features, you can create more dynamic, user-friendly, and persistent experiences. For example, you might use timers to spawn enemies periodically, text input to let players enter their names, and file I/O to save their scores for the next play session.

---

### Concept A: Timers and Scheduled Events

**What Are Timers?**

A timer is a mechanism to measure elapsed time. In games and applications, timing is crucial. You might want to:

- Spawn enemies every few seconds.
- Display a message after a short delay.
- Implement cooldowns for abilities or limit how long a user can perform an action.

**Creating and Using Timers:**

SplashKit provides functions for working with timers:

- `create_timer("my_timer");` creates a named timer.
- `start_timer("my_timer");` begins counting from zero.
- `timer_ticks("my_timer")` returns the elapsed time in milliseconds since the timer started.

You can also pause or reset timers as needed. By comparing the current timer value with previously stored timestamps, you can check if enough time has passed to perform certain actions.

**Scheduling Actions with Timers:**

Instead of relying on frame counts (which can vary with performance), using timers ensures consistent real-time behavior. For example:

```c
double last_event = 0.0;
double now = timer_ticks("my_timer");
if (now - last_event > 3000) // 3 seconds
{
    // Perform action here, like spawn an enemy
    last_event = now;
}
```

This approach helps keep your game’s pacing consistent, independent of frame rate.

---

### Concept B: Text Input and Basic UI Elements

**Why Text Input?**

Until now, you’ve mostly used keyboard input for actions (moving a character, pressing ESC to quit). But what if you need the user to enter their name, type a message, or input a code?

Text input allows users to provide arbitrary text, making your application more interactive. This could be for naming a high-score entry, entering chat messages, or configuring settings.

**Capturing Text:**

SplashKit lets you detect when keys are typed. You can build a string by appending letters when letter keys are pressed, handle BACKSPACE to remove characters, and use ENTER (RETURN_KEY) to indicate submission.

Example flow for text input:

- Initialize an empty `std::string user_input`.
- Each frame, check if letter keys are typed; if yes, append that character.
- If BACKSPACE typed, remove the last character (if any).
- If ENTER typed, consider the input complete and use it as needed (e.g., save a name).

**UI Elements:**

While SplashKit doesn’t provide a fully-fledged GUI framework, you can simulate basic UI elements by drawing shapes and text, and checking input conditions. For example:

- **Buttons:** Draw a rectangle and text. If the mouse clicks inside it, perform an action.
- **Sliders:** Draw a line and a draggable circle. Update a value based on mouse position.
- **Menus:** Present multiple text options and navigate them with keys or clicks.

This is rudimentary but sufficient for simple configuration screens or name entry prompts.

---

### Concept C: Saving and Loading Game State

**Persistence:**

Many applications need to remember information between runs. High scores, player progress, configuration options (like volume), and unlocked achievements should be stored so the user can resume later.

**File I/O in SplashKit:**

SplashKit provides basic file functions to read and write text files:

- `file f = open_file("data.txt", file_write);`
- `write_line(f, "some string");`
- `close_file(f);`

To read:

- `file f = open_file("data.txt", file_read);`
- `string line = read_line(f);`
- parse it (e.g., `int score = string_to_int(line);`)

By using a simple text file format, you can store key-value pairs, high scores, or player stats. On startup, try to load the file. If it exists, apply the saved data; if not, use defaults. On shutdown or after certain events, save the current state.

**Data Formats and Parsing:**

Start simple—just store a single integer for high score. Later, you can store multiple lines, JSON-like structures, or CSV files. Proper parsing and validation ensure your game can handle unexpected data gracefully.

---

### Concept D: Other Advanced Features

Depending on your SplashKit version and interest, you might also explore:

- **Networking:** Add multiplayer or online scoreboards.
- **Advanced Audio Control:** More nuanced volume controls, 3D sound positioning.
- **Enhanced Animation Control:** Advanced animation scripting or blending transitions.

These topics are more specialized and may require reading official documentation or experimenting with SplashKit’s extended APIs.

---

### Concept E: Integrating Advanced Features Into Your Project

Where do these advanced features fit into your workflow?

- **Timers:** For pacing game events (spawn waves of enemies at intervals, show a “Hurry up!” message after a certain time).
- **Text Input:** For naming save slots, entering multiplayer lobby codes, or editing configuration values.
- **Saving/Loading:** For persisting high scores, player progress, and settings so users don’t lose their achievements or preferred configurations.

You can combine these features. For instance, after a timer expires, prompt the player for their name (text input), then save their score and name to a file.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Using a Timer to Trigger Periodic Events

**Goal:**  
Spawn a rectangle on the screen every 2 seconds using a timer. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. Create and start a timer.
2. Track `last_spawn` time.
3. Every 2000 ms, add a new rectangle to an array or list of rectangles.
4. Draw all rectangles each frame.
5. ESC exits.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task1.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Use a timer to spawn rectangles periodically.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 2: Basic Text Input

**Goal:**  
Let the user type text. Display it on the screen. Press ENTER to clear input. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. `std::string user_input = "";`
2. On letter keys typed, append that character.
3. On BACKSPACE, remove last character if any.
4. On ENTER, clear `user_input`.
5. Draw `user_input` each frame.
6. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task2.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement basic text input and display.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 3: Saving and Loading a High Score

**Goal:**  
Load a high score from “score.txt” at startup. If not found, high score = 0. The current score increases when pressing SPACE. Press S to save if current score > high score. Display both scores. ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. Try read “score.txt”:
   - If found, parse and set `high_score`.
   - Else `high_score = 0`.
2. `current_score = 0`.
3. SPACE increases `current_score`.
4. Press S:
   - If `current_score > high_score`, update `high_score`.
   - Save `high_score` to “score.txt”.
5. Draw both current and high score.
6. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task3.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Load/save a high score.
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 4: Timed Prompt for Name Input and Save to File

**Goal:**  
After 5 seconds, prompt the user to type their name. Upon pressing ENTER, save it to “names.txt”. ESC to quit anytime.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a timer at startup.
2. After 5000 ms, prompt user for name.
3. Capture name using text input (like Exercise 2).
4. On ENTER, append the name to “names.txt”.
5. Show elapsed time on screen.
6. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task4.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Timed prompt for name and save to file.
    return 0;
}
```

## Autotest Scripts

As before, these only ensure compilation and runtime without crashing. Manual testing is needed for functionality.

### Autotest for Exercise 1

```python
# Save as: task1_test.py
import subprocess
import time

def compile_with_splashkit(src_file, out_file):
    cmd = ["gcc"] + subprocess.run(
        ["pkg-config", "--cflags", "--libs", "splashkit"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    ).stdout.strip().split() + [src_file, "-o", out_file]
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Compilation failed:\n{result.stderr}")

def run_program(exe_file, timeout=2):
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["./" + exe_file], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    time.sleep(timeout)
    proc.terminate()
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    return stdout.strip()

def test_solutions(student_src="task1.c", ref_src="task1_sol.c"):
    compile_with_splashkit(student_src, "task1_student")
    compile_with_splashkit(ref_src, "task1_ref")
    run_program("task1_student")
    run_program("task1_ref")
    print("Exercise 1: Passed (No runtime errors). Manual timer testing required.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions()
```

(For other exercises, similar test scripts can be created.)
