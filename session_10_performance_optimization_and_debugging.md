# Session 10: Performance Optimization & Debugging

## Explanations

### Introduction and Context

As you continue building more complex and feature-rich applications, you’ll confront two common challenges:

1. **Performance Issues:** Your game might slow down, stutter, or respond sluggishly as you add more entities, more complex logic, or higher-resolution graphics.  
2. **Bugs and Unexpected Behavior:** Crashes, incorrect results, or subtle logic errors become harder to track as your codebase grows.

This session focuses on techniques to **improve performance** and **debug issues** in your SplashKit applications. Rather than waiting until the end of development, it’s wise to incorporate these practices continually. By the end of this session, you’ll know how to measure performance, apply simple optimizations, and use debugging strategies to maintain stable, responsive, and well-structured code.

### Concept A: Measuring Performance and Identifying Bottlenecks

**Why Measure Performance?**

Performance optimization is guided by data. Without measuring how fast your code runs or where the slow parts are, you risk wasting effort on unnecessary optimizations. Measuring performance involves:

- **Frame Rate (FPS):** A quick gauge of performance is how many frames per second your game renders. A stable FPS (e.g., 60 FPS) feels smooth, while dips indicate slowdowns.
- **Timing Code Blocks:** If FPS is low, find out which parts of the code consume the most time. For example, maybe your collision checks are too expensive or you’re drawing too many off-screen objects.

**Tools for Measurement:**

- **Timers:** Use SplashKit timers to measure elapsed time. For instance, measure how long one frame takes, or how long a specific function (like collision checking) requires.
- **Frame Counters:** Count frames over one second to calculate FPS.
- **Profiling (External Tools):** While not integrated into SplashKit, external profilers can show CPU usage per function and memory usage patterns.

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**

Common slow areas:

- **Rendering Overhead:** Drawing too many sprites or complex shapes each frame.
- **Collision Checks:** Checking each entity against every other (O(n²)) doesn’t scale well.
- **File I/O in the Main Loop:** Reading/writing files every frame is costly. Move file operations outside the main loop or buffer them.
- **Complex Calculations Each Frame:** Recompute expensive results less frequently, or cache them.

---

### Concept B: Basic Optimization Techniques

**Optimize Where It Matters:**

After identifying what’s slow, apply optimizations. Some common techniques:

1. **Reduce Work per Frame:**
   - Only draw entities visible on screen.  
   - Limit collision checks to entities close to each other (use spatial partitioning like grids or quad-trees).

2. **Caching and Precomputation:**
   - If you repeatedly calculate a complex value (e.g., pathfinding results, expensive transformations), store the result instead of recalculating every frame.
   - Pre-load assets (images, sounds) once at startup to avoid runtime loading delays.

3. **Data-Structure Choices:**
   - Use arrays or vectors for entities to improve CPU cache locality. Iterating over contiguous memory is often faster than chasing pointers.
   - Reduce dynamic memory allocations per frame; pre-allocate memory if possible.

4. **Efficient Loops and Conditions:**
   - If some code runs every frame, ensure loops are tight and conditions are minimized.
   - Unroll or simplify loops if that helps, though modern compilers often optimize loops well.

**Incremental Optimization:**

Tweak one thing at a time and re-measure. This ensures you know which change actually helped.

---

### Concept C: Debugging Strategies

**Why Debugging Is Important:**

Bugs can derail user experience. Crashes, glitches, or unexpected behaviors hurt your game’s reliability. Good debugging practices save time and frustration.

**Debugging Tools and Techniques:**

1. **Logging and Print Statements:**
   - Insert logs at critical points to understand the program’s flow.
   - For example, log player positions, collision outcomes, or variable states.
   - Keep logging optional (toggle via a debug mode) because constant file writes or console prints slow down the game.

2. **Isolate Problems:**
   - If you suspect a certain function causes issues, temporarily remove or disable parts of it to see if the problem persists.  
   - Gradually reintroduce code until the bug reappears, pinpointing the culprit.

3. **Check Common Pitfalls:**
   - Null pointers, out-of-bound array indices, and uninitialized variables are frequent causes of crashes.
   - Infinite loops or conditions that never become false slow or freeze your application.
   - Ensure all resources (timers, files) are properly closed and freed to avoid leaks or weird behavior.

4. **Assertions and Error Checks:**
   - Use assertions (`assert()`) to ensure assumptions hold true (e.g., entity index is always within range).
   - Check return values of file operations, resource loading, and memory allocations.

**Systematic Approaches:**

- **Divide and Conquer:** Narrow down the location of the bug by disabling code sections or using binary search-like strategies in your codebase.
- **Use Timers for Debugging:** Measure if a function takes longer than expected, which might indicate unexpected loops or logic.

---

### Concept D: Advanced Tools and Approaches

**External Profilers and Debuggers:**

- **Profilers (e.g., Valgrind, gprof, Instruments on macOS):** These tools can show you which functions use the most CPU time, highlight memory leaks, and help you understand performance at a deeper level.
- **Interactive Debuggers (e.g., GDB, LLDB):** Step through code line by line, inspect variables at runtime, and set breakpoints to halt execution at critical points.

**In-Game Debug Overlay:**

- Display performance metrics (FPS, number of active entities).
- Show debug messages or bounding boxes around entities.
- Toggle this overlay with a key so you can monitor the game’s state without leaving the application.

---

### Concept E: Integrating Optimization and Debugging into Your Workflow

Don’t wait until you have a massive, complex project to start thinking about performance and debugging:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Always keep an eye on FPS and entity counts.
- **Debug Mode Early On:** Implement a debug mode that can be toggled to print logs or show overlays. This makes diagnosing issues easier.
- **Regular Profiling and Code Review:** Occasionally measure performance and re-check logic to catch issues before they grow larger.

By practicing these habits, you keep your codebase healthy, your performance stable, and your development process smoother.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Frame Rate Display

**Goal:**  
Measure and display frames-per-second (FPS) on the screen. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. Use a timer to measure elapsed time.
2. Count frames over one second, then set `fps = frame_count`.
3. Reset `frame_count` each second.
4. Draw the current FPS each frame.
5. ESC exits.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task1.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement FPS measurement and display
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 2: Conditional Logging

**Goal:**  
Toggle a debug mode (via D key) that logs player’s position to a file each frame when active. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. `debug_mode = false` initially.
2. Press D: debug_mode = !debug_mode.
3. If debug_mode, append player’s x,y to “debug_log.txt” each frame.
4. Draw on-screen “Debug: ON/OFF.”
5. ESC exits.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task2.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement conditional logging of player position
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 3: Simple Optimization Scenario

**Goal:**  
Simulate collision checks among many entities. Show how using a simple distance check before detailed collision reduces the number of checks. Press ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. Entities in an array (e.g., 100 entities).
2. Without optimization: Check collision between player and every entity (count checks).
3. With optimization: Only do detailed collision if entity is within a certain radius (e.g., 200px) of the player.
4. Compare total checks vs performed checks. Display both counts on screen.
5. Press O to toggle optimization on/off.
6. ESC exits.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task3.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    double x,y;
    bool active;
} Entity;

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement simple optimization scenario
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 4: Debug Overlay

**Goal:**  
Create a debug overlay showing FPS, entity count, and a debug mode status. Press D to toggle debug mode, ESC to quit.

**Instructions:**

1. Reuse FPS code from Exercise 1.
2. Suppose you have a certain number of entities. Display the count.
3. If debug_mode = true, show “DEBUG MODE ON.”
4. This overlay should appear above the game content.
5. ESC exits.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task4.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement debug overlay with FPS, entity count, and debug message
    return 0;
}
```

## Autotest Scripts

These tests ensure code compiles and runs without immediate errors. Manual testing is needed to verify logic.

### Autotest for Exercise 1

```python
# Save as: task1_test.py
import subprocess
import time

def compile_with_splashkit(src_file, out_file):
    cmd = ["gcc"] + subprocess.run(
        ["pkg-config", "--cflags", "--libs", "splashkit"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    ).stdout.strip().split() + [src_file, "-o", out_file]
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Compilation failed:\n{result.stderr}")

def run_program(exe_file, timeout=2):
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["./"+exe_file], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    time.sleep(timeout)
    proc.terminate()
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    return stdout.strip()

def test_solutions(student_src="task1.c", ref_src="task1_sol.c"):
    compile_with_splashkit(student_src, "task1_student")
    compile_with_splashkit(ref_src, "task1_ref")
    run_program("task1_student")
    run_program("task1_ref")
    print("Exercise 1: Passed (No runtime errors). Check FPS visually.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions()
```

(For other exercises, similar test scripts can be made.)
