# Session 8: Collision Detection & Physics Basics

## Explanations

### Introduction and Context

As your applications and games become more sophisticated, you’ll often need objects to interact in meaningful ways. For instance, a player might run into a wall, pick up an item, or hit an enemy with a projectile. To handle these scenarios, you need **collision detection**—a means of determining when two objects overlap—and **physics basics**—simple models that govern how objects move and respond to forces like gravity.

This session shows you how to:

1. Detect collisions between objects using bounding shapes (like rectangles).
2. Decide what to do when collisions occur (e.g., stop movement, apply damage, pick up an item).
3. Introduce simple physics concepts like gravity and basic bounces to create more natural and believable motion.

By applying these principles, you add depth and realism to your interactive worlds.

### Concept A: Collision Detection Basics

**What Is Collision Detection?**  
Collision detection determines if two objects in your game occupy overlapping space. If they do, we say they’ve collided. Common scenarios:

- The player character touching a solid wall.
- A projectile hitting an enemy.
- The player overlapping with a pickup item.

**Representing Object Boundaries:**
To detect collisions, you need a geometric representation of each object’s area. Common approaches:

- **Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs):** Simple rectangles aligned with the x and y axes. Check if two rectangles overlap horizontally and vertically.
- **Bounding Circles:** Use circles instead of rectangles. Collision occurs if the distance between centers is less than the sum of radii.
- **More Complex Shapes (Convex Polygons, Pixel-Perfect):** More accurate but more computationally expensive, usually not needed for simple games.

For now, AABBs are sufficient. They’re easy to compute and fast to check.

**AABB Collision Check:**
Given two entities A and B:
- `A_left = Ax`
- `A_right = Ax + A_width`
- `A_top = Ay`
- `A_bottom = Ay + A_height`

And similarly for B. AABB overlap if:
```
A_left < B_right &&
A_right > B_left &&
A_top < B_bottom &&
A_bottom > B_top
```

If all these are true, the boxes intersect. 

**Acquiring Dimensions:**
If using sprites, `sprite_width()` and `sprite_height()` give dimensions. Otherwise, store width/height in your entity struct.

---

### Concept B: Responding to Collisions

Once you detect a collision, what’s next?

Common responses:

- **Stop Movement:** If a player walks into a wall, set `dx = 0` and position the player so they no longer overlap the wall.
- **Damage or Destroy Entities:** If a projectile hits an enemy, reduce the enemy’s health. If health reaches zero, remove the enemy (mark `active = false`).
- **Collect Items:** If the player overlaps an item’s box, remove the item and increase the player’s score.

**Collision Resolution:**
Often, you must reposition objects after a collision to ensure they don’t remain overlapping. For example, if a player’s movement caused them to pass partially through a wall, you might move the player back along the axis of movement until they no longer overlap.

**Order of Operations:**

1. Update positions based on velocity.
2. Detect collisions.
3. Resolve collisions: adjust positions, velocities, or states.
4. Apply any side effects (damage, pickups).

---

### Concept C: Physics Basics – Gravity and Bounces

**Why Physics?**  
Physics concepts like gravity and bouncing add realism. Without gravity, objects may float unrealistically. With it, you get natural falling motion. Bounces add life to objects like balls or enemies that should rebound when hitting surfaces.

**Gravity:**

- Gravity is a constant acceleration downwards.
- Each frame, increase vertical velocity (`dy += gravity`) and then update position (`y += dy`).
- If the object hits the ground, stop it from falling by setting `dy = 0` and placing it on top of the ground.

**Simulating Falling:**
```
gravity = 0.5;
dy += gravity;
y += dy;
```
If `y + height > ground_level`, then `y = ground_level - height; dy = 0;` The object rests on the floor.

**Bouncing:**
When hitting a surface, reverse the velocity and reduce it to simulate energy loss:
```
dy = -dy * bounce_factor;
```
If bounce_factor is 0.8, each bounce loses 20% energy. Eventually, the object settles.

**Friction or Drag:**
To avoid perpetual sliding:
```
dx *= 0.9; // Slowly reduce horizontal speed
```
This makes objects gradually stop moving if no force is applied.

---

### Concept D: Integrating Collisions and Physics with Entity States

Entities might have states (as learned previously) that affect how they respond to collisions:

- A `PLAYER` state might remain `RUNNING` unless a collision forces a change (e.g., hitting an obstacle might stop horizontal movement but not change state).
- A `PROJECTILE` might switch from a `FLYING` state to an `EXPLODING` state upon collision with an enemy.

Physics updates (like applying gravity) happen each frame regardless of state, but the entity’s reaction (like stopping movement after collision) depends on the entity type and state machine logic.

---

### Concept E: Putting It All Together

In a typical frame:

1. `process_events();` – Handle input.
2. Update positions with velocities:
   - `x += dx; y += dy;`
3. Apply gravity and other physics effects (`dy += gravity`).
4. Check collisions with the environment (walls, floor):
   - If collided, resolve by adjusting position and setting `dx` or `dy` to 0.
5. Check collisions between entities:
   - If player hits enemy, deal damage.
   - If projectile hits target, remove projectile and reduce target’s health.
6. Draw everything.
7. `refresh_screen();`

Over time, you can refine collision checks (e.g., layer different collision shapes or add precise resolution) and physics (e.g., multiple forces, slopes), but starting simple is best.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic AABB Collision Check Between Two Entities

**Goal:**  

Create two entities moving towards each other. When they overlap, change the background color. Press ESC to exit.

**Instructions:**

1. Two entities: one moving right-to-left, another left-to-right.
2. Use AABB collision to detect overlap.
3. If colliding, background = red; otherwise black.
4. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task1.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct
{
    double x, y;
    double dx, dy;
    sprite spr;
} Entity;

bool entities_collide(Entity a, Entity b)
{
    // TODO: Implement collision check
    return false;
}

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement basic collision detection scenario
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 2: Stopping Movement on Wall Collision


**Goal:**  
A player moves horizontally. If it hits the right wall of the screen, stop it and keep it inside the boundary.

**Instructions:**

1. Player starts at (100,300), dx=2.
2. If `x + sprite_width > window_width`, set `x = window_width - sprite_width` and `dx=0`.
3. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task2.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct
{
    double x, y;
    double dx, dy;
    sprite spr;
} Entity;

int main()
{
    // TODO: Wall collision stopping movement
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 3: Applying Gravity and Landing on the Floor

**Goal:**  

An entity starts in mid-air. Apply gravity so it falls. When it hits the bottom (the “floor”), it stops there.

**Instructions:**

1. gravity = 0.5
2. Each frame: `dy += gravity; y += dy;`
3. If `y + sprite_height > window_height`, set `y = window_height - sprite_height` and `dy=0`.
4. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task3.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct
{
    double x, y;
    double dx, dy;
    sprite spr;
} Entity;

int main()
{
    // TODO: Gravity and floor collision
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Exercise 4: Simple Bounce on Collision with Floor

**Goal:**  
Make an entity bounce when it hits the floor. Each bounce loses energy.

**Instructions:**

1. gravity = 0.5
2. On hitting the floor: `dy = -dy * 0.8;`
3. If `fabs(dy) < 0.5`, then `dy=0` to stop bouncing.
4. ESC to exit.

**Starter Code:**
```c
// Save as: task4.c
#include "splashkit.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

typedef struct
{
    double x, y;
    double dx, dy;
    sprite spr;
} Entity;

int main()
{
    // TODO: Implement bounce behavior
    return 0;
}
```

## Autotest Scripts

As before, these tests check compilation and basic execution. Manual testing is needed to ensure collisions and physics behave correctly.

### Autotest for Exercise 1

```python
# Save as: task1_test.py
import subprocess
import time

def compile_with_splashkit(src_file, out_file):
    cmd = ["gcc"] + subprocess.run(
        ["pkg-config", "--cflags", "--libs", "splashkit"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    ).stdout.strip().split() + [src_file, "-o", out_file]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Compilation failed.\n{result.stderr}")

def run_program(exe_file, timeout=2):
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["./" + exe_file], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    time.sleep(timeout)
    proc.terminate()
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    return stdout.strip()

def test_solutions(student_src="task1.c", ref_src="task1_sol.c"):
    compile_with_splashkit(student_src, "task1_student")
    compile_with_splashkit(ref_src, "task1_ref")
    run_program("task1_student")
    run_program("task1_ref")
    print("Exercise 1: Passed (No runtime errors). Collision logic requires manual check.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solutions()
```

(Additional autotests for other exercises are similar, just changing filenames and print messages.)
